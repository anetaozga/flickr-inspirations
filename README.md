# Getting Started with Flickr API

Simple React-based App that shows capabilities of Flickr API. It provides search, infinity scroll, safe search toggle and path-based searching.

The App is created using a mobile-first approach without any third-party UI library. I  built the design with the help of Styled Components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
